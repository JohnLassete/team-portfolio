When you think about protecting your confidential data from a cyber-attack, it\u2019s a good idea to put it in perspective: It\u2019s not a matter of \u201cif\u201d an attack will happen, it\u2019s a matter of \u201cwhen\u201d and if your organization will be prepared to respond and recover from it.

A proactive approach will certainly cost you less in the long run, preventing the cascading effects of a security breach that never seem to end. It\u2019s best to implement security practices, policies, and tools that help to detect and neutralize a breach before your environment is compromised.

They describe procedures for managing and eliminating threats, helping you keep security measures at a high level, avoid confusion during a breach, and reduce breach reaction times, where time is of the essence.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Deploy an activity monitoring solution:<\/span><\/b><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> A continuous user activity monitoring solution provides you with data on each action inside your protected perimeter. Such software deployed in a law firm monitors servers and endpoints, alerts security officers of suspicious user activity, records daily operations, and provides the means to review any security incident.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Encrypt stored sensitive data:<\/span><\/b><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> If a hacker or malicious insider obtains encrypted sensitive information, it will be impossible to read and use. To access such files, a user or server has to request access rights from a content owner (also a user or server.) It\u2019s best to encrypt data both at rest and in transit to ensure layered protection.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Control third-party actions:<\/span><\/b><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> Attacking an organization through a third-party vendor is a common attack vector. Subcontractors usually have elevated access rights in the client\u2019s environment, but they don\u2019t always pay attention to security. To avoid such incidents, check a vendor\u2019s compliance with cybersecurity standards and enforce access management and activity monitoring.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Manage access granularly:<\/span><\/b><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> The idea of several access levels to corporate data is well-established in the legal industry. With digital data protection, it works the same way: security officers manage employees\u2019 access to sensitive information and carefully adjust access levels to the needs of each employee. Best practice tells us that the minimum level of access should be provided to accomplish assigned duties.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Prevent unauthorized apps from executing in ways that compromise data: <\/span><\/b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">This can be accomplished through <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.snaptechit.com\/article\/application-control-101\/\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Application Control<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\">, allowing you to impose application-specific security policies for your legal firm.
