In the world of data protection and cybersecurity, ensuring compliance with best practices has never been more essential \u2013 especially when it comes to government contracts.<\/p><p>So, what is CMMC? And how can you make sure your business complies? This blog post will uncover the answers to these questions so that you can ensure your business operates securely and meets all necessary requirements. Read on to find out everything about CMMC compliance.<\/p><p><strong>Understanding CMMC Compliance<\/strong><\/p><p>CMMC is a unified standard created to ensure that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.defense.gov\/News\/Releases\/Release\/Article\/2833006\/strategic-direction-for-cybersecurity-maturity-model-certification-cmmc-program\/\">DoD<\/a> contractors have adequate cybersecurity defenses in place to protect sensitive information. The objective of CMMC compliance is to enhance the cybersecurity posture of organizations in the defense supply chain and safeguard the confidentiality of government data. Non-compliance with CMMC can result in the loss of contracts and significant reputational damage. Therefore, it&#8217;s critical for organizations that interact with the DoD to become CMMC compliant and maintain an elevated level of cybersecurity maturity.<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-610750d elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"610750d\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2><strong>What is CMMC 2.0?<\/strong><\/h2><p>The implementation of CMMC 1.0 was met with a compliance bottleneck due to the overwhelming number of firms requiring third-party assessments. Unfortunately, the total number of available CMMC Third-Party Assessor Organizations (C3PO) was not growing rapidly enough to meet demand. As a result, the Department of Defense (DoD) acted swiftly to address these concerns with the release of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.snaptechit.com\/article\/pulling-back-the-curtain-on-cmmc-2-0-how-changes-affect-dod-contractors\/\">CMMC 2.0<\/a>.<\/p><p>The new framework simplifies the compliance process and reduces its burden, which is especially beneficial for the tens of thousands of smaller companies that comprise the bulk of the defense industrial base (DIB). The DoD recognizes that cybersecurity maturity and investment can be achieved just as effectively through a tiered approach, with the vast majority of firms self-attesting to compliance. CMMC 2.0 addresses the bottleneck of third-party assessors and acknowledges the vast differences in risk management between smaller manufacturers and large, sophisticated prime contractors.<\/p><p>With CMMC 2.0, companies have more flexibility and can make real, concrete investments in cybersecurity without necessarily engaging third-party assessors or auditors. These changes give companies greater control over their compliance efforts.<\/p><p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Let&#8217;s examine the most significant changes in the new CMMC framework.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3269\" src=\"https:\/\/www.snaptechit.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/CMMC-2.jpg\" alt=\"CMMC 2.0\" width=\"935\" height=\"728\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.snaptechit.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/CMMC-2.jpg 935w, https:\/\/www.snaptechit.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/CMMC-2-300x234.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.snaptechit.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/CMMC-2-768x598.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 935px) 100vw, 935px\" \/><\/p>\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-2e2919a elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"2e2919a\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong style=\"font-family: inherit; font-size: 30px;\">What are the CMMC 2.0 levels?<\/strong><\/span><\/h2><ul><li><strong>Level 1:<\/strong> This level of compliance is mandatory for all federal contractors in possession of Federal Contract Information (FCI).<\/li><li><strong>Level 2:<\/strong> This level of compliance is required for all federal contractors handling:<ul><li>Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) \/ Controlled Defense Information<\/li><li>Controlled Technical Information (CTI)<\/li><li>ITAR or export-controlled data<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><strong>Level 3:\u00a0<\/strong>This level applies to companies that handle CUI for DoD programs with the highest priorty.<\/li><\/ul><h3><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>What are the CMMC 2.0 level requirements?<\/strong><\/span><\/h3><ul><li><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Level 1:<\/strong> the Department of Defense has classified a set of cybersecurity practices as &#8220;Basic&#8221; for FCI handling. To meet the Level 1 requirement, contractors must implement 17 basic cybersecurity practices and self-attest to their successful implementation.<\/span><\/li><li><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Level 2:<\/strong> 110 practices, including those mandated by NIST SP 800-171, and subject to third-party assessments for \u201ccritical\u201d national security information. It is important to note that Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) already mandated compliance to NIST 800-171 controls and was already the law of the land for federal sub-contractors before the advent of CMMC.<\/span><ul><li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The new CMMC 2.0 framework introduces a &#8220;bifurcated&#8221; approach for Level 2 organizations. For companies participating in \u201ccritical\u201d programs or &#8220;prioritized acquisitions,&#8221; companies must undergo a third-party assessment every three years and conduct annual self-assessments. Subcontractors can rely on their prime contractors to determine if their supply agreements fall under prioritized acquisitions.<\/span><\/li><li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">For all other contractors at Level 2, the contractor should perform an annual self-assessment or self-attestation. In our view, the vast majority of defense subcontractors will fall into this category.<\/span><\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Level 3:<\/strong> Requires adherence to NIST 800-171 and certain elements of the NIST 800-172 standard.

One of the most significant advantages of CMMC compliance is increased cybersecurity and risk mitigation. By establishing a solid set of security protocols and best practices, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.snaptechit.com\/cmmc-level-1-readiness-gauge\/\">organizations can protect themselves<\/a> from breaches, data loss, and other security threats.<\/p><p>Additionally, achieving CMMC certification can give companies a competitive advantage in government contracts, as more government entities are requiring contractors to be certified. Being CMMC compliant also helps demonstrate an organization&#8217;s trustworthiness to customers and partners, giving them peace of mind and ensuring long-term business relationships. Early adopters of the CMMC approach will build with key customers and likely win more than their fair share of business as the CMMC compliance process matures.<\/p><p>Finally, CMMC compliance ensures protection of sensitive information and intellectual property, safeguarding business interests and sensitive data. Overall, achieving CMMC certification can bring a wealth of benefits to manufacturers of all sizes.<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-df85ffc elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"df85ffc\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/h2><p>CMMC compliance is crucial for any company dealing in information related to supplying the Department of Defense. To ensure the security of this sensitive data, businesses must obtain a certification that proves their ability to meet cybersecurity standards set by the government. Achieving these certifications can be an arduous process and likely require the assistance of knowledgeable professionals who are dedicated to helping companies achieve compliance.<\/p><p>Attaining CMMC compliance is worth it for companies as they protect not only their property, but also the safety and security of the US armed forces. Compliance is also an important way for companies to remain competitive and relevant in today\u2019s world and highlights the seriousness with which businesses take cyber security.<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-section elementor-top-section elementor-element elementor-element-b21e460 elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default\" data-id=\"b21e460\" data-element_type=\"section\" data-settings=\"{&quot;background_background&quot;:&quot;classic&quot;}\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column elementor-element elementor-element-920b422\" data-id=\"920b422\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-8f83915 elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"8f83915\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h4 style=\"color: white;\">If you&#8217;d like more information on CMMC compliance, join us for a free, 30-minute consultation with one of our compliance experts today:<\/h4><h3><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.snaptechit.com\/contactus\">Contact<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.snaptechit.com\/contactus\"> Us<\/a><\/strong><\/h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The importance of CMMC (Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification) compliance for businesses handling defense contracts.
