A report from a cybersecurity firm\u2019s research indicates\u202f<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"><strong>cyber-attacks against banks spiked by a massive 238%<\/strong> from the beginning of February to the end of April 2020.\u202f<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">In 2021, financial firms saw the highest volume of cybersecurity attacks over any other industry. This threat landscape is widening as it is getting more sophisticated and diverse.\u202f<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The average cost of a data breach in the financial sector in 2021 was $5.21 million, according to reports from IBM &amp; Ponemon Institute. In 2021 alone, the banking industry experienced an increase of 1,318% in ransomware attacks.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">As fast as organizations are adopting new-age technologies, hackers are constantly finding ways to penetrate and target exploitable security vulnerabilities. Thus, making it evident that cybersecurity attacks are increasing rapidly every passing year.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6}\">\u00a0<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Cybersecurity attacks continue to make the headlines, and 2021 was no exception for the banking industry. Large financial institutions like Automatic Funds Transfer Services, Flagstar &amp; CNA Financial were among a slew of financial business hit. Some of the most headline-making cyber-attacks have been the DDoS attacks. These attacks flood customer-facing bank websites with traffic and take them offline or attacks on the Swift based money transfer systems, among others.\u202f<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6}\">\u00a0<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">What Does This Mean for Small-Mid-Sized Financial Firms?<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559739&quot;:225}\">\u00a0<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The continue onslaught of cyber-attacks on larger financial firms begs the question for smaller firms. If larger financial businesses with a multitude of resources to protect data are continually being hit, how is a smaller firm supposed to protect business data with limited resources &amp; infrastructure in place? Cybercriminals understand that expertise &amp; resources pose a difficult challenge for smaller financial firms &amp; are willing to target them as low-hanging fruit. It\u2019s less work for the cybercriminal to gain access to a smaller firm that isn\u2019t properly structured &amp; has not made any time or resource investments in cybersecurity to protect their business. The smaller firms present a golden opportunity for cybercriminals to make a steady profit from stealing confidential information &amp; collecting a ransom, once they\u2019ve threatened to release the stolen data on the dark web, as an example.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559739&quot;:225}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Protecting Critical Assets<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559739&quot;:225}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Not only do banks store money, but also gather network activities and personal information of the customers. Information that includes names, phone numbers, addresses, email addresses, and dates of birth. This data has inherent value and can be used for other malicious activities such as identity theft, which can often lead to more disastrous consequences to the bank &amp; the customers themselves.<\/span> <span data-contrast=\"none\">Cybercriminals are relying on advanced with modern technologies, often more modern than some smaller financial institutions. They develop custom-built malicious code that is routinely missed by antivirus protection alone. Addressing the need for stronger<a href=\"https:\/\/www.snaptechit.com\/cyberdefense-protect\/\"> protection<\/a> in the financial sector as whole, is essential to thwarting the next attack.<\/span><span data-contrast=\"none\">\u00a0<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">The banking industry should be cognizant of the assets they have stored and what mechanisms might be used by attackers to get into their organization. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.snaptechit.com\/cyberdefense-identify\/\">Identifying<\/a> the weak points and the measures needed to strengthen the IT infrastructure, based on the risk assessment, to defend against those potential threats is necessary in building an optimized cybersecurity program.<\/span> <span data-contrast=\"none\">This critical shift from passive cybersecurity to defensive cybersecurity is necessary for financial organizations. This redirected mindset &amp; approach puts financial organizations in the driver\u2019s seat, tackling cyber threats in a proactive manner. It\u2019s not a time to embrace the hacker to test the strength of IT security. At that point, it could be too late.\u00a0<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6}\">\u00a0<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559739&quot;:225}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">While focusing on the security of systems is imperative, it\u2019s important to concentrate on enlisting employees as your first line of defense in preventing hackers from reaching your network. Employees that are taking the necessary steps to defend the perimeter is a crucial piece of overall cybersecurity. This requires ongoing awareness training that includes approaches hackers take to find their way in &amp; what can be done to minimize risk exposure to the business.\u00a0<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6}\">\u00a0<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559739&quot;:225}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Basic Steps to Minimize Your Risk<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559739&quot;:225}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">To be honest, financial firms, or any business, for that matter, should avoid relying on the obsolete IT infrastructure.
